<image align="center" src="imagesandstuff/picgoeshard.png">

## Requirements
 - [BepinEx 5](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases/tag/v5.4.21) 
 - Latest legit version of Receiver 2
 - **HIGHLY RECOMMENDED** [BepInEx Config Manager](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx.ConfigurationManager)
 ## Download & Installation		
 - Download the files in the releases section.<br />
 - Copy the folder called _"GunSceneReenabler"_ in **GunSceneReenabler.zip** to (where you have R2 installed) **Receiver 2\BepinEx\plugins**
  ## Usage
 - By default, press "**L**" to load into the scene, then just, idk, follow the help menu top left of the screen
 - Press "**Q**" to go back
 - If you want to change the key to load into the scene, press F1, then click on GunSceneReenabler, and change the key to whatever
 ## KNOWN ISSUES
 - Throws an error when you quit back to the splash screen, doesn't affect anything AFAIK (UMP Related)
 - You can't re-assemble the cool gun
 - You have to press "**1**" six times after the cool gun before anything else shows up, that's normal, blame Wolfire for still not having released the guns >:(
 - None of the guns have magazines, might be able to fix that, I'll see
